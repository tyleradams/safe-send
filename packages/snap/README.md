# Safe Send - MetaMask Snap

This snap helps ensure users safely send transactions, with a special focus on identifying Polymarket deposit addresses and validating transaction details.

## Knowledge Document

### Purpose and Functionality

Safe Send is a MetaMask snap that enhances transaction security by providing real-time validation and feedback on outgoing transactions. The snap specifically helps users identify Polymarket deposit addresses and validates that transactions are properly configured for this purpose.

### Key Features

- **Transaction Analysis**: Examines transaction details including recipient, network, and token type
- **Polymarket Address Verification**: Identifies Polymarket deposit contracts and validates their authenticity
- **Security Warnings**: Provides clear, color-coded alerts about potential issues with transactions
- **Network Validation**: Ensures users are on the correct network (Polygon) for Polymarket transactions
- **Token Verification**: Confirms users are using the correct tokens (USDC/USDCe) for Polymarket deposits

### Permissions Used

- `endowment:transaction-insight`: Allows the snap to analyze transaction data before signing
- `endowment:ethereum-provider`: Enables querying blockchain data to verify contract details
- `snap_dialog`: Creates user dialogs to display transaction analysis results
- `snap_manageState`: Stores persistent data when needed

### User Flow

1. User initiates a transaction in MetaMask
2. Safe Send analyzes the transaction details
3. The snap displays a confirmation dialog with security analysis
4. Color-coded indicators show safety status:
   - ‚úÖ Green: Safe to proceed
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow: Caution advised
   - ü•µ Red: Potential danger, transaction should be canceled

### Security Considerations

- This snap does not modify transactions - it only provides information
- No external API calls are made; all validation happens locally or via the connected blockchain
- The snap only has access to transaction data you're already sending through MetaMask
- This is an independent project not officially affiliated with or endorsed by Polymarket
